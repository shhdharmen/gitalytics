## About

### What is this?

I built an app called Gitalytics, which will show summarized GitHub Activities.

I got inspired from Spotify Year in Review feature and thought that developers should also see their GitHub Year in Review, a.k.a [#2020Coded](https://twitter.com/search?q=%232020Coded&src=typed_query).

### How I built it

I have created an NX workspace using angular-nest preset. For more on code visit my article on dev.to: [Basic Structure Done with Nx and Deployed on DigitalOcean App Platform](https://dev.to/shhdharmen/gitalytics-basic-structure-done-with-nx-and-deployed-on-digitalocean-app-platform-5a6p)

## Development

### Environment Variables

A sample is provided a `.env.sample` file.

| Variable          | Description                                  | Dev Value                        | Prod Value                       | Needed for           |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- | -------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| `PAT`             | GitHub Person Access Token                   | `TOKEN`                          | `TOKEN`                          | Backend              |
| `API_URL`         | GitHub GraphQL API Endpoint                  | `https://api.github.com/graphql` | `https://api.github.com/graphql` | Backend              |
| `PORT`            | Where you want to run your nestjs app        | `3000`                           | `8080`                           | Backend              |
| `WHITELIST_URL`   | Comma separated URLs to allow access to APIs | `http://localhost:4200`          | `FRONT_END_APP_URL`              | Backend              |
| `NODE_ENV`        | Environment where app is running             | `development`                    | `production`                     | Backend and Frontend |
| `BACKEND_API_URL` | URL where api is running                     | `/api`                           | `BACK_END_APP_URL`               | Frontend             |

You can create an app and get keys for twitter bot from: <https://apps.twitter.com/>.

### Local Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shhdharmen/gitalytics
cd gitalytics
npm i
```

After that, copy content from `.env.sample` and create `.env` with values.

#### Running the projects

**Client (Frontend)**:

```bash
npm run config
nx serve api
```

**API (Backend)**:

```bash
nx serve client
```

#### GraphQL

All the GraphQL related stuff is maintained at: `apps/client/src/.graphql`. You can generate related angular service and typescript file using below command, thanks to [GraphQL Code Generator](https://graphql-code-generator.com/):

```bash
npm run generate-codegen
```

## Instructions to Deploy

### Important Notes on Deployment

- Make sure you have all your environment variables in place
- You will need to add frontend app urls separated by comma to `WHITELIST_URL` in environment variables
- You will need to add backend api url in `BACKEND_API_URL` in environment variables
